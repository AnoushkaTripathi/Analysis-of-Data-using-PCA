Some times while training a machine learning model can lead to following problems
1. slow training time because of computational complexity
2. Overfitting of training data
3.multi collinearity
4. Data Storage problem
5. Lack of Data points
So, to solve this problem Dimensionality reduction can help us a lot
 this is a small project made by me which involves the use of PCA a dimensionality reduction algorithm
